Unzip this file and the script.

You need to have the files in the folder in which you call the script:
lat.in (from ATAT)
POSCAR (from VASP -> we want to convert this to str.out in ATAT format)
POTCAR (from VASP)

I have included example files in this zip folder.

If these are not the names of the files go to the conversion script and change them in lines 34-36.

Then you just run the script:
chmod u+x (if you do not already have premission to run it)
./CONVERT_POSCAR_TO_STROUT.sh

An error occurs if you do not have the lat.in and/or POSCAR and/or POTCAR files.
Also, if the number of atomic positions in your POSCAR does not match the number of atoms (I dont know why this would be the case ever but say you had a typo) it exits with an error.

Finally, if you have an atom in your POTCAR which is not present in your lat.in the script complains.
This situation should not really occur: Your structure contains atoms only present in lat.in so the POTCAR should
not contain other atoms!

That's it.
